                <h2> About Me </h2>
                <p> My name is Odin, and I am a student at Droemtorp vgs in Norway.
                    I am a first year at Informationtecknology and mediaproduction, and I plan to go IT next year.
                    This is my portofolio in one of my classes, KP. That is where we do all our coding, and programming.
                    In this portofolio you will see all the rojects I have been working on in KP, both the big ones and the small ones.
                    The assigmnet I haven't compleated will also be here.
                    So here you will be able to see my progression, throughout my IT-developer jurny.
                    I really enjoy coding and programming, and learning new things.
                    I mostly like backend programing and coding, where I dont have to worry about how to make it look good.
                    When I am not at school you will probably find me at the scout, I am pritty active there.
                    I am a memeber of Muldvarpen Roverlag, and I help out as a leader at Siggerud Speidergruppe.
                    On my free time I like to play video games and workout.

                    This was an assignment about licences.
                    We were going to pick 5 images with different creative common licens and explain what the licens meant.
                    We were originally going to just do it in word, but then our teacher changed his mind.

                </p>

                    About everything else was up to us. This was also the last assignment we had before we got introduced to java script.

                <p> If I had more time I had more time I would make The dropbox assignment way better, but it works.</p>
                
                <h3> Java Script </h3>
                <a href="https://1ima-1imb.github.io/kpodin.github.io/js_intro/index.html"> First Java Script</a>
                <p>
                    This is the first javascript assignment we made. Where we learned how to make variables, functions, parameters, and how to use console log to write it out.
                     We also learned how  If - Else worked. You will see that there is not much to see at the website, that's becuse we used console log.
                     So if you inspect it, and go to console log, you will se more.
                <a href="https://1ima-1imb.github.io/kpodin.github.io/js_intro/sauer/index.html">Sheep</a>
                <p> This was an assignment with many different  assingmnets in one. We explored javascript more through this, I got done with almost everything.
                    However, the last assingment is to get this to show on the website, and I didnt have time to compleate this, before we started on a new project.
                </p>
                <a href="https://1ima-1imb.github.io/kpodin.github.io/js_intro/fahrenheit-celsius/index.html"> Fahrenheit - Celsius Converter</a>
                <p>
                    In this project we were going to make a fahrenheit and Celsius converter, with html and CSS.
                </p>
                <a href="https://1ima-1imb.github.io/kpodin.github.io/js_intro/liter-converter/index.html"> Liter Converters</a>     
                <p> In this javascript assignment we were going to build a liter converter website.
                    Combining all we have learned, and then check if the input is a parameter or not.
                    This one is compleated, however there is some complications I should fix to make it better.
                </p>
                <h3> Projects I am working on </h3>
                    <p>This portofolio is a project that I am constantly working on, to update whenever we start new projects.
                        I am also working on the design to make it look better.
                    </p>

                    <a href="https://1ima-1imb.github.io/kpodin.github.io/mediaquery_odin/"> MediaQuery</a>
                    <p> This was the first time we were introduced to media query, to make wedsites responsive.
                        It is meant to be ugly, but it also doesn't work properly.
                    </p>
                    <a href="https://1ima-1imb.github.io/kpodin.github.io/js_intro/if-it-walks-like-a-duck/index.html">If it walks like a duck</a>
                    <p>
                        This assingment was to make to boxes, and write out "It must be a duck" in console log if both boxes were checked,
                        or "It is not a duck" if both is not checked.
                        This asingmnt is not done, but I have moved on to other stuff becuse it was too easy.
                        I will come back to it, when I have the time.
                    </p>
                    <p> These are all the assingments we have had untill now, but we constantly start new proojects, so there will be more soon.</p>
