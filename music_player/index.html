                <h2>Who is ghost?</h2>
                <p> Ghost is a swedish rock band that formed in 2006. Unlike otherbands they have alot of lore.
                    In the lore universe, ghost is an devil-worshipping theistic satanic church that is conducting rituals over the world in order to spread their massage.
                    They pose as a band to become populare and reach more poeple.
                    The Cleregy controls the ministry with Sister Imperator as their qurent leader.
                    The lead singer of the band is a satanic pope like figure, who gain the title Papa Emeritus.
                    There has been 4  papa Emeritus, Cardinal Copia or Papa Emeritus IV is the curent one. The band also consist of many nameless ghouls.
                    The fanbase usually give them headcanon names. the ghouls get switched out from time to time, some of the passed once had canon names. </p>

                <p>For a long time all of the bands indentities was consealed, but due to a cort case they got reviled, and we found out that Tobias Forge is the creator of ghost.
                    He is also the one acting as the different Papa Emeritus characters. Some Christians that are against ghost belive that the fictional story of ghost is true,
                    or atleast parts of it. They belive that ghost is actually summoning the devil, which is no way near the truth, for multiple reasons. </p>

                <p>  Satanist does not look at satan as a figure of evil, witch the fictional story of the band does.
                    Real satanism is no way near what the band makes it to be. The band follow what the big misconception of what people think satanism is.
                    It is worth to mention that Tobias Forge is a statanist, but like most satanist he is an atheist and does not belive that satan really exist.
                    Satanism look at satan as a methaphore for how people should behave.
                    They focus on individualism insted of spiritualism. They follow the  mindset of "people can do whatever they want aslong as they dont hurt anyone"
                    A big misconseption of satanism is that they hurt babys or animals for their rituals, and this is infact the oposit of what satanism is.
                    Two of the rules they folow is specificly not to kill animals unless you are atacked or for food, and  do not to harm children.
                </p>
                <p> Anyway, back to Ghost!</p>
