                I come from Norway and I was in korea for a 3 weeks, and the whole reason why I was in korea was becuse I was a participant in The World Scout Jamboree camp.
                Jamboree is the biggest international scout camp, that happend every 4 years.
                This is a camp where we expirience new cultures, and meet scouts from all over the world.
                I learned so much, and made so many friends that I still have contact with to this day.
                This was an amazing expirience that I will never forget. However, they were some challenges.
                We were originaly going so spend about 9 days in Seoul, and about 14 days at the campsite, but due to a typhoon stricking the camp, the campsite time got way shorter.

                What you see in the picture abow is a typhoon.
                the storm becomes stronger and stronger the closer you get to the middle.
                The middle of the storm was about to hit our camp, so we had to pack our stuff, and we got evacuated.
                We did not know where we were going, just that it was some place in Seoul.
                It turned out that our parents had goten an e-mail, wich said we were going to stay at an amarican military camp.
                We ourself had not heard anything about this, and it turned out we were not going to stay at a military camp.
                We were staying at a undone hotel in seoul.
                The hotel had a bathroom, kitchen, washer, and a fridge, but not any furniture.
                So not any beds, we needed to sleeap on the floor.
                We had giten used to that, becuse we had been sleeping in tents at the camp for 5 days.
                However, the strangest thing about this hotel was that the bathroom had seethrough windows.
                We were able to see right through the shower, and toilet.
                We had to gafataip towels to the window.
                The day  day the typhoon were going to hit, we needed to stay inside our hotel room for 24 houers.
                We had responsability to get all our food suplies ourself, so we needed to find something to eat the day before.
                that was a challenge becuse the covinient stores were so different than what they are in Norway.
                We weere unsure witch part of the typhoon that was going to hit where we were, and when it was going to hit.
                We only knew it was some time in this 24 houer time frame.
                The time we though the typhoon was going to hit got delayed many times before it actually hit.
                We had been told there could be flything object, and we needed to stay away from the windows.
                The intensity of the typhoon all depended on what part of it that hit us.
                It turned out only the very edge hit us, so we did not expirience anything else than what seemed like a strong Norwigian storm.
