        <h1> Images and Licences</h1>
        <p> The image you see abow explains creative comons licens, and it infact has creative comons licens.
            However, it has some terms you have to follow when you use it. Those terms are called Atribution and ShareAlike.
            Atribution means that you have to give apropriate credits, and link to the licens and indicate if changes were made.
            The other term were ShareAlike, this means that if you make any kind of changes to the image, you must distribute it under the same Licens.
            You can also not add other terms that restrict other from using the image. Exept for this you can do whatever you like.
